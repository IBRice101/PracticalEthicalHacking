# Practical Ethical Hacking - The Complete Course

My notes, scripts, and other miscellaneous files for the course "Practical Ethical Hacking - The Complete Course" by Heath Adams ([@thecybermentor](https://www.twitter.com/thecybermentor))

This course became free for a short window of time in 2021 for reasons explained in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/thecybermentor/status/1424630773534109699?s=20), and as a result I thought I, a BSc. (Hons.) Ethical Hacking student in Abertay, should give it a shot to see if there's anything I can learn in the course. In particular Heath's section on Active Directory is of great interest to me, as this is an area that I'm not quite up to speed on just yet.
